## Status and To Do
* Grid15 classes are done except for more optomization
* CommandUI is pretty much done, except for better parsing of invalid arguments and commands
* Making a GUI (see the GTKSlide branch) and one that works with Windows too
* Setup command line parser
* Create consistent versioning
* Setup makefiles or some other build system
* Spelling needs work, and UTF-8 support with Windows builds needs fixing
* Better/more documentation (espicially this file)
* Testing for macOS (I don't have a mac of any kind)
* More support for Windows in general
* Choose a licence
