# 15Slide
A cross-platform(ish) slidy-tile game written with C++17!
## Building
### Linux
* Get the termcolor library from [http://termcolor.readthedocs.io/](http://termcolor.readthedocs.io/)
* Intall the gtkmm libraries for your distrubution (see [https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/](https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/))
* Put the termcolor and 15Slide src folder in your build directory
* Run 
## Status and To Do
* Grid15 classes are done except for more optomization
* CommandUI is pretty much done, except for better parsing of invalid arguments and commands
* Making a Gui (see the GTKSlide branch)
* Spelling throuought needs work, and UTF-8 support with Windows builds needs fixing
* Better/more documentation
* Choose a licence
